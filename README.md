# Sapphire Proxy
A work in progress Proxy service, mainly meant for the penalty box that Blocksi can put people in.
What is the penalty box you ask? It sucks really.

the Penalty box restricts access to most things, even google! 
Sapphire is meant to bypass this restrictions set by Blocksi.

NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK! 
Progress on the proxy might have setbacks here and there for personal reasons.
